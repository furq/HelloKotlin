# HelloKotlin

## Introduction
**HelloKotlin** is a personal repository where I am learning and practicing **Kotlin**. As a **newbie in Kotlin**, I use this space to explore Kotlin's syntax, functions, and features. The goal is to build a solid foundation in Kotlin by working through small examples, exercises, and experiments.

## Objectives
- Get familiar with **Kotlin syntax**.
- Practice writing and calling **Kotlin functions**.
- Understand basic concepts such as:
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Control Flow (`if`, `when`, loops)
  - Functions and Lambdas
  - Classes, Objects, and Inheritance
  - Collections (Lists, Sets, Maps)
  - Error Handling

## How to Use this Repository
1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HelloKotlin.git
   cd HelloKotlin
