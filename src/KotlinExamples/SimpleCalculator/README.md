# Simple Calculator App

## Objective:
Build a simple calculator app that allows the user to perform multiple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## Features:
1. **Prompt the user to input two numbers.**
2. **Display a menu** to select an operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) or Exit.
3. Use **`when` expression** to handle the selected operation.
4. Ensure **division by zero** is handled gracefully with an error message.
5. Use a **loop** to allow multiple operations until the user decides to exit.
6. **Display the result** of each operation to the user.
7. Provide **error handling** for invalid inputs.
8. Display a **goodbye message** when the user exits.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository or copy the Kotlin code to your local environment.
2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or any other Kotlin-supported IDE.
3. Run the **`SimpleCalculator`** class containing the `main` function.
